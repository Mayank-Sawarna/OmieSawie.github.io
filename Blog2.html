                <br /><br />Technology in the modern world is proceeding even faster than what can be perceived by our awareness. Necessity might have been the mother of invention in ancient times, but now it is more like a chase with time, an urge to create better than the best. And that certainly involves time and cost efficient inventions. One such is a metamaterial, a material that can be precisely designed for properties in accordance to the application. A fine example might be cited from a YouTube video which explains it rather perfectly. Light waves, when passing through a lens, converge because the waves travel faster along the thin upper and lower parts of a convex lens while they travel slower at the middle, now, a lot of effort therefore, is invested in perfecting the shape of the lens. However, in case it is decided to use metamaterials in place of a lens, the job will be a lot simpler. It will just be developing a grid of materials where the one in the middle has the properties to slow down the light wave. Shape will no longer be a factor, thus creating a more efficient solution. 
                <br /><br /><br />
                Use of metamaterials in infrastructure is a topic that is being investigated for quite some time. Metametarials interact with waves in many waves, which are engineered such that it is able to manipulate seismic waves as well. These are broadly known as seismic metamaterials. Research proposes a device developed by combining properties of seismic metamaterials. This device, if positioned below a building, promotes seismic isolation of the structure. Seismic cloaking barrier uses metamaterials to redirect and attenuate seismic waves. Therefore, this can protect structures from a lot of damage due to disastrous earthquakes. It might not be possible to prevent earthquakes but their effects can be reduced by improving resilience in modern infrastructures. Seismic metamaterials can be developed as mechanical metamaterials capable of absorbing up to 90% vibrational energy, thereby protecting other objects in the event of an earthquake. This approach also reduces the need for reinforcing materials as well as increasing seismic protection.
